Example plugin for Ark: Survival Evolved Steam Servers
====================
This plugin isn't very special and simply shows as a demo of how you can hook ShooterGameServer.exe functions
to implement a basic dependency-free server plugin for Steam & Epic games. The advantage of creating a plugin by
hooking game functions is immense, as it allows you not only far more power and customizability, it doesn't
require players or admins to download any mods.
